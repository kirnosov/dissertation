% Sample Dissertation, Thesis, or Document %
%            for use with the              %

%               uathesis.cls               %
%------------------------------------------%

% We'll use the uathesis document class (duh).  The uncommented line
% below will produce a Dissertation, the others would produce a Thesis
% or a Document.  There are other options available to you like turning
% on the copyright statement and replacing the year on the title page
% with a "generated on" stamp (handy for early drafts).  To find out
% what the available options are, take a look into the uathesis.cls
% file and look for the \DeclareOption commands near the top of that
% file.
% There are five copyright options.  Copyright, no copyright, and three
% different Creative Commons licences.  Use the one you want (If you go
% Creative Commons, I (DM) think the CC-BY-ND makes the most sense)  See
% uathesis.cls for the reason why the non-commercial licenses are not
% included.

% Package Usage
% These are the packages that we need
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{physics}
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{natbib}			% natbib is available on most systems, and is
					% terribly handy.
					% If you want to use a different Bibliography package, 
					% you should be able to, just change this
					% and the \bibliographystyle command below.  Be warned
					% that you may need to do a little hacking to get
					% the REFERENCES item to show up in your TOC.

% Compatibility with the AASTEX package 
% of the American Astronomical Society.
%\usepackage{deluxetable}		% Allows use of AASTEX deluxe tables
%\usepackage{aastex_hack}		% Allows other AASTEX functionality.

% These are other packages that you might find useful.
% For controlling the fonts, see
% http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hartke/computer/latex/survey/survey.html
% The following is a nice font set:
%\usepackage{mathtime}			% Times for letters; Belleek math.
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}			% AMS Math (advanced math typesetting)
%\usepackage{lscape}			% Used for making fitting large tables in by putting them landscape
%\usepackage{refs}			
%
% If you are using hyper-ref (recommended), this command must go after all 
% other package inclusions (from the hyperref package documentation).
% The purpose of hyperref is to make the PDF created extensively
% cross-referenced.
\usepackage[bookmarks,colorlinks=true,urlcolor=black,linkcolor=black,citecolor=black]{hyperref}

% Set up some values.
\completetitle{Advances In Physical Systems Modeling Using 
Explicitly Correlated Gaussian Functions}
\fullname{Nikita Kirnosov}			% Grad college wants your full name here.
\degreename{Doctor of Philosophy}	% Title of your degree.
