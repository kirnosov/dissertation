In this dissertation recent advances in modeling various 
atomic and molecular systems' with quantum mechanical 
calculations employing 
explicitly correlated Gaussian functions are presented.
The author has utilized multiple approaches and considered
a number of approximations to develop optimal calculation
frameworks. Electronic and muonic molecules and atoms
have been considered.
A number of unique calculations have been performed and 
some novel and interesting results have been generated.
